The goal of this project is to be a almost complete build-time replacement for Jackson Databind, that does not rely on reflection and has a smaller runtime footprint.

As a way of comparison Micronaut Serialization is a 380kb JAR file, compared to Jackson Databind which is well over 2mb. This results in a reduction of 5MB in terms of image size for native image builds.

The elimination of reflection and smaller footprint also results in higher throughput and reduced runtime memory consumption.

In addition, unlike Jackson, you cannot serialize or deserialize arbitrary objects to JSON. Allowing arbitrary serialization is often a source of security issues in modern applications. Instead with Micronaut Serialization to allow a type to be serialized or deserialized you must do one of the following:

1. Declare the ann:serde.annotation.Serdeable[] annotation at the type level in your source code to allow the type to be serialized or deserialized.
2. If you cannot modify the source code and it is an external type you can use ann:serde.annotation.SerdeImport[] to import the type. Note that with this approach only public members are considered.
3. Define a bean of type api:serde.Serializer[] for serialization and/or a bean of type api:serde.Deserializer[] for deserialization.
