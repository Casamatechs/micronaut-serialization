There are a number of ways to use Micronaut Serialization including a choice of annotation-model and runtime.

The first step however is configure the necessary annotation processor dependency:

dependency::micronaut-serde-processor:{version}[scope="annotationProcessor", group="io.micronaut.serde"]

You should then choose a combination of Annotation-based programming model and runtime implementation that you desire.
